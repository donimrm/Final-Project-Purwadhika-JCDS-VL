> # __Introduction__

A Portuguese retail bank was addressed, having declined asset because of financial crisis that happened worldwide in 2008. They wished for a solution to increase the bank's asset by contacting their clients to reserve their fund in a term deposit with a certain interest rate. 

By having their clients' fund in a term deposit, the bank would be able to  lend the money out to borrowers by charging the borrowers with a higher interest rate and gain profit from the interest rate spread. Furthermore, bank could also use the deposit fund as a sales & trading services and mergers & acquisition (M&A) advisory services.

We found out that during the dataset was taken, specifically within 2010-2013 was the lowest point of Portuguese financial crisis. During these time, people might be scared to put their money on bank, as bank could collapse during financial crisis. One of the objective from the bank itself is how to build trust to their clients so they are willing to put their money on a term deposit in the bank. The condition mentioned above, however, we do not have any indicators on how to increase clients' trust to the bank.

In this project, we position ourselves as a part of the Data Science Team in Financial Institution field, a Portuguese retail bank. We are assigned to work on a project to develop a Machine Learning solution that will help the bank in sorting out possible existing clients that will likely put a term deposit in the bank. Therefore, could increase the effectiveness of the marketing campaigns held by the bank.

This project will be using a dataset that describing Portugal bank marketing campaigns results from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/volodymyrgavrysh/bank-marketing-campaigns-dataset).

> ## __Problem Definition__<br>

The objective of this project is to analyze the dataset's result of past bank telemarketing campaign and perform machine learning algorithms for predicting valuable customers who will join a term deposit product. The dataset was taken from 2008 to 2013 and it had an imbalance data with the majority of negative result distribution. As the bank's data scientists, we decided to focus on minimizing False Negative Class.

Evaluation metric that we will use is **Recall**. Where we will minimize false negative class - where we predicted clients that will not open a term deposit, turns out they actually want to open a term deposit. As our objective is to have as many clients to open a term deposit, therefore increasing recall will decrease this type of error.

> ## __Business Objectives__
The business goals that want to be achieved through this project are as follows:

> Business Problem for ML
- How to predict a successful term deposit so the Portugese bank can target the right client that will open a term deposit through a telemarketing?<br>

> Business Problem for Analytics
- What customer should we target that will most likely open a term deposit? <br>
  - How to predict a successful term deposit based on client's education data?<br>
  - How to predict a successful term deposit based on client's housing loan data?<br>
  - How to predict a successful term deposit based on client's job data?<br>
  - How to predict a successful term deposit based on client's marital data?<br>
  - How to predict a successful term deposit based on client's age data? (Age Range: 16-25, 26-35, 36-45, 46-55, > 55)<br>
  - How to predict a successful term deposit based on client's loan data?<br>
  - How to predict a successful term deposit based on client's last month contact during campaign?<br>
  - How to predict a successful term deposit based on client's type of contact?<br>
  - How to predict a successful term deposit based on client's data on previous outcome of marketing campaign?<br>
